Hybrid ALNS-LS for Waste Transportation Optimization

This repository contains the implementation of a Hybrid Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search with Local Search (ALNS-LS) algorithm for optimizing waste collection routes in Surakarta, Indonesia.

Reproduces main results: 113.60 km total distance

Notes:
1. Collection Point Coordinates: Available upon request from corresponding author (subject to DLH approval).
2. Distance/Duration Matrices: Real-road network distances calculated via OpenRouteService API.
3. Gurobi Exact Method: Solves Surakarta CVRP independently, not direct comparison with ALNS-LS. Exact method implementation requires Gurobi license.
4. Instance Benchmarking: Some outputs are incomplete and were obtained from multiple script runs.
